## About the Project 🌐

The **Calculadora EDO** is a script that allows users to solve first and second-order differential equations interactively by inputting coefficients and functions. Although initially envisioned as a web application, this project is currently available as a Python script.

### Supported Equations

#### First-Order Equations
- General form: `A * dy/dx + B * y = C`

#### Second-Order Equations
- General form: `A * d²y/dx² + B * dy/dx + C * y = D`

---

## Features 📊

- Interactive input for equation coefficients.
- Solves:
  - **First-order ODEs**
  - **Second-order ODEs**
- Built using Python’s mathematical capabilities.
- Easy-to-understand syntax and design.

## How to Use 🔧

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oalbertocavalcante/calculadora-edo

## Examples 📚

### First-Order Equation
**General form:** `A * dy/dx + B * y = C`

#### Example 1
- `A = 2`, `B = 3`
- `C = e^x + 0`

#### Example 2
- `A = 1`, `B = -1`
- `C = x^2`

### Second-Order Equation
**General form:** `A * d²y/dx² + B * dy/dx + C * y = D`

#### Example 1
- `A = 1`, `B = 2`, `C = 1`
- `D = e^(2x) + 0`

#### Example 2
- `A = 1`, `B = -3`, `C = 2`
- `D = sin(x)`
